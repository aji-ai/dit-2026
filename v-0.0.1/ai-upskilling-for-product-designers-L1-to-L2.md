# Working Within SAE 🚗➕ L1 (and Preparing to Move to L2)

*AI suggests; the designer drives every step*

This is the **entry point for most product designers** using AI today.

* **L1** = AI helps you *think, draft, and explore*
* **L2** = AI helps you *build bounded production chunks*

The shift is not automation — it’s **clarity, judgment, and intent**.

## What “Good” Looks Like at SAE L1

By the top of L1 (Integrator → Architect), a designer can say:

* “I know when AI helps — and when it hurts.”
* “I can explain why I trusted or rejected an AI suggestion.”
* “My prompts are assets, not one-off chats.”
* “Quality is still my responsibility.”

L1 maturity is about **judgment**, not automation. AI augments thinking; the designer remains accountable for outcomes.

---

### What L1 Looks Like in Practice

* AI is used to brainstorm, summarize, draft, or remix
* Most AI output is rewritten or refined
* QA lives in taste, experience, and intuition
* Speed improves, but quality still depends on the designer

### Typical L1 Tools

* General LLMs: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini (chat)
* Visual ideation: Midjourney, Firefly, Krea
* Embedded helpers: Figma Make, Notion AI, Docs copilots

## SAE L1 × E-P-I-A-S Growth Path

### ❶ Explorer → ❷ Practitioner

*(From novelty to consistency)*

**Goal:** Stop trying AI. Start using it deliberately.

**What to learn**

* What AI is good at vs poor at
* How framing affects results
* When regeneration helps vs wastes time

**Concrete upgrades**

* Reuse AI for the same task
* Save prompts that work
* Add light structure: context → task → output

**Signal**

> “I know when AI will help before I ask it.”

---

### ❷ Practitioner → ❸ Integrator

*(From isolated prompts to full-task use)*

**Goal:** Embed AI across an entire task.

**What to learn**

* Use AI across multiple steps (research → draft → refine)
* Separate AI suggestions from design decisions
* Maintain traceability and accountability

**Concrete upgrades**

* Reuse prompts intentionally
* Note where AI was used and reviewed
* Explain why outputs were accepted or rejected

**Signal**

> “I can clearly explain what AI contributed — and what I decided.”

---

### ❸ Integrator → ❹ Architect

*(From personal workflow to reusable system)*

**Goal:** Make AI-assisted work reusable by others.

**What to learn**

* Turn prompts into patterns
* Design review habits around AI output
* Teach judgment, not tricks

**Concrete upgrades**

* Prompt libraries organized by task
* Simple review checklists (accuracy, tone, accessibility)
* Examples of good vs risky outputs

**Signal**

> “Others can use my prompts and get similar-quality results.”

---

### ❹ Architect → ❺ Steward

*(From reuse to responsibility)*

**Goal:** Set standards for responsible AI-assisted design.

**What to learn**

* Where AI introduces risk (hallucination, bias, IP)
* How governance can enable speed
* How to mentor without prescribing

**Concrete upgrades**

* Clear guidance on acceptable AI use
* Review norms for AI-assisted work
* Coaching on judgment and accountability

**Signal**

> “AI use is trusted here because expectations are clear.”

---

# The Transition: L1 → L2 (The First Production Shift)

This is the moment designers stop asking AI to *help*
and start asking it to *build*.

**What changes at L2**

* Prompts become instructions
* Outputs are expected to be usable
* Quality moves from intuition to checklists

**Mental shift**

> From “help me think about this” → “build this bounded thing”

L1 forges judgment.
L2 operationalizes it.

---

## How Designers Move from L1 → L2

### Step 1: Identify Safe-to-Automate Chunks

Designers automate bounded units:

* UI components
* Copy blocks
* Small flows

If it has clear inputs and a clear “done,” it’s a candidate.

---

### Step 2: Turn Prompts into Instructions

L2 requires **less creativity, more clarity**:

* Context
* Constraints
* Output format
* Acceptance criteria

This is where many designers stall.

---

### Step 3: Add a Simple QA Loop

Before integration, run the same checks:

* Design system fit
* Accessibility basics
* Tone and hierarchy

No eval frameworks yet — just repeatable review.

---

### Step 4: Reuse, Don’t Re-Prompt

Reusing prompts intentionally is the moment you leave L1.

**Signals**

* You copy/paste on purpose
* You expect similar quality each run
* You know how to fix failures

---

## L1 → L2 in E-P-I-A-S Terms

* **L1 Steward → L2 Explorer**
  You stop optimizing prompts and ask:
  *Which parts of my work can AI reliably build?*

* **Carry-over skill:** judgment
  Strong L1 maturity makes L2 safer and faster.

> An S-Steward at L1 is better prepared for L2 than an E-Explorer chasing advanced tools.
